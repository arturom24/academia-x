    <p>I contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in one fewer
    god than you do. When you understand why you dismiss all the other

     <p>The truth may be puzzling. It may take some work to grapple with.
     It may be counterintuitive. It may contradict deeply held
     prejudices. It may not be consonant with what we desperately want to
     be true. But our preferences do not determine what's true. We have a
     method, and that method helps us to reach not absolute truth, only
     asymptotic approaches to the truth — never there, just closer
     and closer, always finding vast new oceans of undiscovered
     possibilities. Cleverly designed experiments are the key.</p>
